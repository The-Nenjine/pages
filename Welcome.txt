           Welcome to Docs!
---------------------------------------

			 - Introduction -

Docs has been built so that it can be a
helpful companion while you code. It is 
built so that others can add their own 
files to docs if their app requires 
documentation.

The Picotron documentation is currently
being added, and so the current version
has incomplete information. If you would 
like to help write the documentation feel 
free to reach out to me (Hessery) on 
discord.

Docs may lag if other processes are 
eating cpu time while on the desktop. 
I recomend you create the toolbar 
shortcut for easy access from any 
workspace. 


		 - Creating a shortcut -

There are a few easy ways to add a 
shortcut to Docs on your system.

	1. Putting Docs in the tool tray.
	2. Adding Docs to the toolbar.
	

	1. Putting Docs in the tool tray.

You can add Docs to the tool tray by 
dragging down the bar at the top of the 
screen and then drag-n-dropping Docs into 
the space revealed.


	2. Adding Docs to the toolbar.

> Be careful, as this allows you to 
> modify your /system folder, which is 
> usually protected from edits!

To create a shortcut on the toolbar:
1.	load #localsys and follow the prompts 
	to localise your system
2.	In /system/wm/wm.lua on ln 3146 put
	the following:
	
> add(item, {"\^:2e2a282424002424 Docs", 
> function() create_process(
> "/apps/docs.p64") end})

3. Reboot


		- Adding your own docs -

There are two ways to add your own documentation to docs:

	1. Install option from your cart.
	2. Source addition.

	1. Install option from your cart.

Copy pages from somewhere in your cart into /appdata/docs/pages.


	2. Source addition.
	
Users can add sources from settings. You can supply a url that points to a location on a webserver where can be found a manifest.txt and files etc etc
