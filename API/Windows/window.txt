> window(width, height, attribs)
> window(attribs)

Creates a window and sets the window's 
attributes.

'width' and 'height' are the dimensions 
of the window.

'attribs' is a table of attributes to 
assign to the created window.


The following are the attributes that can 
be given to a window.

	- x
The x position to create the window at.

	- y
The y position to create the window at.

	- width
The width of the window (not including 
the frame).

	- height			
The height of the window (not including 
the frame and title bar).

	- title			
The text displayed on the title bar.

	- pauseable		
False to turn off the app menu that 
appears when you press enter. Defaults to 
false.

	- tabbed			
True to open in a tabbed workspace (like 
the code editor).

	- has_frame
If false, removes the frame and title bar. 
This also stops you from moving or 
resizing the frame, makeing the moveable 
and resizeable attributes irelevant.

	- moveable
Allows you to move the window by 
dragging the title bar. Defaults to true.

	- resizeable
Allows you to resize the window by 
dragging the corners of the frame. 
Defaults to true.
	
	- wallpaper
Replaces the current wallpaper with the 
window. Will make the window frameless, 
immoveable, unclickable and will draw 
colour 16 anywhere the window is not.
	
	- autoclose
Close window when not in focus or escape 
is pressed.
	
	- z	
What height to create the window at. 
Defaults to 0, wallpaper is -1000.	
	
	- cursor
Does not seem to currently work.

	- workspace
Which workspace to open in. Useful for 
creating windowed apps that open in other 
fullscreen workspaces.

N.b.
Cursor doesn't seem to currently work. 
Zep's Manual currently states that 
system curosrs are named and can be 
requested using the following strings:

	- pointer
Hand with a finger that presses down 
while mouse button is pressed.

	- grab
Open hand that changes into grabbing pose 
while mouse button is pressed.


	- dial
Hand in a dial-twirling pose that 
disappears while mouse button is held 
down.

	- crosshair
The manual only names this one. 
Presumably, it is the cursor when 
selecting a region to take a screen shot 
of using capture.
