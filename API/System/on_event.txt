> on_event(event, func)

Creates a listener that runs a function 
when the given event is triggered. See 
send_message().

'event' is a string that identifies when 
the function should be called.

'func' is the function to call. The 
function will recieve a single argument 
of data that the event is called with. 
Usually this is expected to be a table.

The following shows how a procress could 
create a child process and process data 
it sends back:

> child_window = create_process(
> 	"popup.lua", 
> 	{parent_window = pid()}
> )
> 
> on_event("spacePressed", function(msg)
> 	if msg.selection then 
> 		notify("Selection is true") 
> 	end
> end)
