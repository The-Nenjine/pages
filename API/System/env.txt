> env()

Returns a table of environment variables 
given to the process when it starts.

As of 0.1.1b these are the default 
environment variables for a empty cart:

> argv="",
> corun_program="/ram/cart/main.lua",
> parent_pid=3,
> prog_name="/system/apps/terminal.lua",
> reload_history=true,
> title="terminal",
> window_attribs={
> 	pwc_output=true,
> 	show_in_workspace=true
> }

'argv' seems to be arguments given when 
calling the process from the terminal.

'title' and 'window_attribs' seems to be 
all variables that can be changed with 
window.

'sandboxed' is a boolean, whether the 
process is able to perform certain 
functions such as: create_process()
