> collectgarbage(method, var)

A function for interacting with lua's 
built-in memory management system. It is 
on by default.

The garbage collector may return a value.

'method' should be one of the following:

	"collect"
Runs one complete garbage collection 
cycle.

	"count"
Returns the amount of memory currently 
used.

	"restart"
Restarts the garbage collector if it has 
been stopped.

	"setpause"
Changes the time to elapse between 
collection cycles to 'var'. Defaults to 1.

	"setstepmul"
Changes the speed of the garbage 
collector compared to that of memory 
allocation to 'var'. Defaults to 2.

	"step"
Runs one step of garbage collection. 
'var' is the step size. Returns true if 
the step was the last step of a garbage 
collection cycle.

	"stop"
Stops the garbage collector if it is 
running.

N.b.
Typically "count" returns as kilobytes, 
but it may be that it returns bytes in 
Picotron.
