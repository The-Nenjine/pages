> create_process(path, env)

Creates a new process.

Returns the new process' process id.

'path' is the path to the .lua file to 
run.

'env' is a table to patch into the new 
process' environment table.

See env() for what keys are used by
Picotron in the default environment table.

The process id returned can be used by 
send_message() for cross process 
communication.
