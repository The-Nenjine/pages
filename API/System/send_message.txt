> send_message(pid, data)

Sends an event to a specified process. 
See on_event() for how to recieve these 
messages.

'pid' is the process id to which we are 
sending the data.

'data' is a table, which contains the 
data that the process should recieve and 
the event that the data should be 
processed on.

The following shows how a popup window 
could send data back to the parent 
window:

> parent_window = env().parent_window
> 
> function _update()
> 	if keyp("space") then
> 		send_message(parent_window, {
> 			event = "spacePressed",
> 			selection = true
> 		})
> 	end
> end
