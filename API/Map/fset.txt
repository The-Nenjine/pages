> fset(n, [f], val)

Sets the value of 'n' sprite's 'f' flag.

'f' is the flag index, between 0..7.

The initial state of flags 0..7 are
settable in the sprite editor, so can be 
used to create custom sprite attributes. 
It is also possible to draw only a 
subset of map tiles by providing a mask 
in map().

When 'f' if is omitted all flags are set 
with a single bitfield.
