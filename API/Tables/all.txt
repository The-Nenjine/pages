> all(tbl)

Used in for loops to iterate over all 
items in a table, as long as all items 
are indexed sequentially.

Instead of 'i' being the index of the 
table as it would be in doing this:

> for i = 1, #tbl do

'i' becomes the value stored at that 
index in the table, like this:

> tbl = {1, 2, 3, 4}
> for i in all(tbl) do
>    print(i)
> end
