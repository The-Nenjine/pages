> print(str, [x, y, [col]])

Prints 'str' to the screen and optionally 
sets the draw colour.

Returns the right most x position that
occurred while printing.

When x, y are not specified, a newline is 
automatically appended. If called to the
console, printing below y 122 will cause
the console to scroll. This can be 
disabled with the following code:

> poke(0x5f36,0x40)

? can be used to call print without 
brackets:

> ?"Hello World!"
