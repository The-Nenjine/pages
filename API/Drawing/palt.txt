> palt(c, [t])

Sets a colour as transparent or opaque.

'c' is the colour to change the 
transparency of. 

't' is whether to set the colour as 
transparent.

If 'c' is the only argument, it is 
treated as a bitfield and sets all 64 
transparency values.

Calling palt without any arguments sets 
all colours to opaque except for colour 0.

Transparency is observed by the following
functions:

> spr()
> sspr()
> map()
> tline3d()

N.b. Does this set transparency on the 
draw palette and not the display palette, 
right? Could it be a transparency palette
that sits before the draw and display 
palletes...
