Write one or more bytes to an address in 
base ram. If more than one value is 
provided, they are written sequentially.

'addr' is the address in ram to start 
writing at.

'val' is the value to write to ram.

poke() writes i8 values to ram.
poke2() writes i16 values to ram
poke4() writes i32 values to ram.

N.b.
What is base ram? Zep's Manual entry for 
peek doesn't specificy peeking at base 
ram, just ram.

Zep's manual suggest that there is a i64 
version of poke. That could be poke8,
but due to also naming peek4 and poke4 
twice as valid functions, there seems to 
be some confusion on this.
