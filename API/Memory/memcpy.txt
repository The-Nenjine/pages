> memcpy(dest, src, len)

Copies data from ram from one place to 
another.

'dest' is the starting address to copy 
to.

'src' is the starting address to copy 
from.

'len' is the number of bytes to copy.

Sections can overlap, but makes the 
function run at a higher cost to cpu.

N.b.
What is base ram, and how is it different 
from ram?
