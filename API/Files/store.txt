> store(path, obj, [metadata])

Stores a lua object as a file.

'path' is the path to where the file is to 
be stored.

'obj' is the object to be stored.

When storing data that should persist
between launches, the data should be
stored in /appdata, within an 
appropriately named folder. 

'metadata' should be given as a table. 
Data given is added to the file metadata 
without overwriting data.
