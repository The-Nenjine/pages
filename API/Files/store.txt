> store(path, obj, [metadata])

Stores a lua object as a file.

When storing data that should persist
between launches, the data should be
stored in /appdata, within an 
appropriately named folder. 

'metadata' should be given as a table. 
Data given is added to the file metadata 
without overwriting data.
