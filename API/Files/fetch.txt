> fetch(path)

Return a lua object stored in a given 
file. Returns the object and metadata.

'path' can be a relative or absolute 
path to a local file, or it can be a web 
address to download from the internet.

Web addresses will cache their response
for each session, so that repeated 
fetches of the same url will result in 
the same output even if the file 
returned by the server is the same.

N.b. Is the string length limit still 128 
chars?
