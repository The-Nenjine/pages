> mkdir(path)

Creates a directory given a specified 
'path'.

Generally a cart would store it's 
persistent files in /appdata/<cart name>,
so the first time a cart is run it would 
need to create the directory before 
storing files in it.

The following code will check to see if 
the folder has been created in /appdata, 
and then will create it if it doesn't 
exist.

> if fstat("appdata/game") == nil then
>    mkdir("appdata/game")
> end
