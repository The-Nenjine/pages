> include(path)

Loads and runs a lua file.

See pwd() for more infomation on how 
paths are formatted to be relative or 
absolute.

Unlike pico8's #include, include() is a 
regular function that is called at 
runtime. 

The following two code blocks are the 
same as far as testing shows.

> include("file.lua")

> file = fetch("file.lua")
> load(file)()

N.b.
Zep's manual says that the following 
should work, but as of 0.1.1b it causes 
a crash.

> load(fetch("file.lua"))()
