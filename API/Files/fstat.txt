> fstat(path)

Finds data about a file system object.

Returns either "file" or "folder", and 
then the size of the object.

Folders will always return a size of 0.

For example:

> t, s = fstat("/system")
> print(t)
> print(s)

Will print:

> folder
> 0

See f(pwd()) for more infomation on how 
paths are formatted to be relative or 
absolute.

N.b.
Zep's manual says that there should be a 
third value returned; a string which 
gives the full path of the file being 
analyzed.
