> pod(val, [flags], [metadata])

Creates a POD in a specified format, with 
metadata.

Returns a Picotron Object Data (POD) 
string.

'val' is the data to encode.

'flags' determins the format in which to 
encode the data, which defaults to 0x0.

'metadata' is an optional value that is 
encoded into the string and stores 
additional information about the pod.

pod() will return nill if 'val' contains 
functions, circular references and other 
non-encodable references.

The following flags are available:

	0x0		The default behaviour.
	0x1		pxu: Compressed RLE-style.
	0x2		lz4: Binary compression pass 
			(dictionary matching)
	0x4		base64: A text friendly format.

As a bitfield argument, 'flags' can be 
any combination of the available encoding 
types. For instance, 0x3 compresses 
twice, once with pxu and then with lz4, 
or 0x7 which compresses with pxu and lz4 
and then returns the pod in a base64, 
plain text readable format.

'metadata' is returned as a second value, 
and can be any lua object.

N.b.
Is flag 0x0 just plain text?
