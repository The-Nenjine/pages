Coroutines are functions that can be 
interupted and resumed at will. 

A greate example of why you would want 
to use a coroutine is fetch(). Usually 
fetch() make the entire program wait 
while it recieves data. This can make the 
program appear to hang if the server 
takes a while to respond, or if the file 
is rather large. If you put fetch() in a 
coroutine, when it is called, it will 
yeild(), allowing your program to 
continue running, and allows you to come 
back and collect the data returned at a 
later time.
