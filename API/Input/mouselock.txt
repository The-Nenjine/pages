> mouselock(lock, event_sens, move_sens)

Returns 'x' and 'y', the relative 
position of the mouse since the last 
frame.

When 'lock' is true, Picotron makes a 
request to the host OS's window manager 
to capture and control the mouse's 
sensitivity and movement speed.

'event_sens' is a number, 0..4 that 
multiplies how far the mouse has moved, 
per Picotron pixel.

'move_sens' is a number between 0..4, 1 
meaning the mouse continues to move at 
the same speed.
