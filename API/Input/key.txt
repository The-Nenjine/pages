> key(k, [raw])

Returns the state of key 'k'.

The name of each 'k' is the same as the 
character is produces on a US keyboard, 
with exceptions of a few keys:

Special characters:
	"space"
	"delete"
	"enter"
	"tab"
	"ctrl"
	"shift"
	"alt"
	"pageup"
	"pagedown"
	
By default f(key()) uses the local keyboard 
layout. To get the raw output, as if the 
button was pressed on a US keyboard, 
set 'raw' as true.
