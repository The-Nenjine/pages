Footnotes:
1.	Needs to be turned on in settings.
2.	Is commented out in wm at ln ~2020
3.	Sends a 'menu_action' message to the
	active window from wm, so is tagged
	as Picotron.
4.	Checks if the current program is 
	loaded into 'ram/cart' and saves the 
	cart, if not sends a 'save_file' 
	message to the currently active 
	program.
5.	Currently bugged in full screen 
	programs.
6.	Unknown if this actually does 
	anything.
7.	Picotron doesn't currently capture
	audio, but the shortcut is setup for
	when it will.
